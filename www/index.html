                    So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
                    <br>Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
                    <br>A smile from a veil?
                    <br>Do you think you can tell?
                    <br>Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
                    <br>Hot ashes for trees?
                    <br>Hot air for a cool breeze?
                    <br>Cold comfort for change?
                    <br>Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
                    <br>How I wish, how I wish you were here.
                    <br>We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
                    <br>Running over the same old ground.
                    <br>What have we found?
                    <br>The same old fears.
                    <br>Wish you were here.
